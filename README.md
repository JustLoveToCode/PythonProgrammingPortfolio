I would like to give credits to Angela Yu and Ardit Sulce for the Wonderful and Fabulous tutorials on Python Programming.
These are the Python Programming tutorials that I have code along and I would like to showcase it on Github Repository.
Note that all the codes are not commercialized and the porfolio are only for showcase purposes.
